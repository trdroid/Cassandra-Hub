# Cassandra

**Features**

Cassandra is a column-oriented data store that is

* distributed
* decentralized
* fault-tolerant
* eventually consistent
* linearly scalable

*Distributed*

Cassandra can be deployed to a cluster of machines located at different geographical places. 

*Decentralized*

Cassandra does NOT have a central master server which implies

* no bottleneck
* no single point of failure

*Fault-tolerant*

As data is replicated, a faulty node can be replaced readily without any downtime. 

*Linearly Scalable*

As Cassandra is *linearly scalable*, the throughput can be increased by adding more nodes. 


**Joins**

Cassandra does not support joins like a relational database does.
